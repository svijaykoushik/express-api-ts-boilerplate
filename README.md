# express-api-ts-boilerplate

Welcome to `express-api-ts-boilerplate` ‚Äì a developer-friendly boilerplate that equips you with essential tools and a clear structure to build robust, scalable RESTful APIs using Express.js and TypeScript.

## üöÄ Why Choose This Boilerplate?

- **Ready-to-use Architecture**: Begin your project with a thoughtfully organized structure.
- **Secure by Design**: Strengthen your API with built-in middleware such as Helmet and CORS.
- **Database Integration**: Use SQLite3 with TypeORM or easily swap it out for MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB as needed.
- **Validation Made Easy**: Utilize `class-validator` and `class-transformer` for streamlined data validation.
- **API Documentation**: Effortlessly generate comprehensive API documentation using `swagger-jsdoc`.
- **Enhanced Password Security**: Securely hash passwords with `bcrypt`.
- **Type Safety**: Harness the power of TypeScript to catch errors early and improve code quality.
- **Customizable**: Swap and customize packages as needed to suit your project requirements.

## üõ† Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/svijaykoushik/express-api-ts-boilerplate.git
    cd express-api-ts-boilerplate
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure the application**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory for environment variables. Refer to the provided `.env.example` file.

4. **Run the application**:
    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

    Your server will start on the port specified in the configuration, typically `http://localhost:3000/`.
